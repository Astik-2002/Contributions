# Ardupilot Contributions

### [AP DDS: Added imu data transmission via DDS ](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/26187)
Enabled high frequency imu data transmission for offboard control and sensor fusion
### [Custom Control:Added LQR-I controller for multirotor attitude control](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/26469)
Development of LQR controller with integral action for quadcopter attitude control
### [Scripting: Modified Plane_doublet example](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/26472)
Fixed doublet script to return to level flight after doublet finishes, and for actuating all control actuators

### [Potential field based high speed collision avoidance algorithm for UAVs](https://github.com/Astik-2002/Dynamic-artificial-potential-field-algorithm-for-cooperative-obstacle-avoidance-for-fixed-wing-UAV)
A dynamic collision avoidance algorithm, designed for allowing high speed UAVs operating in cluttered environments/swarms to savely traverse while optimally avoiding collisions.
### [Offboard sensorfusion on embedded platform via mavlink](https://github.com/Astik-2002/Embedded-MAVLink)
Data communication between a teensy 4.1 and pixhawk cube is enabled via mavlink, for fusion of airspeed data provided by a twin pitot tube system.
### [Model Predictive Controller design for fixed-wing UAV](https://github.com/Astik-2002/Design-of-a-model-predictive-control-for-a-twin-engine-micro-fixed-wing-UAV)
Design of a robust MPC controller for trajectory control of a fixed-wing uav. Fixed-wing's lateral and longitudinal state-space model was identified using XFLR5
